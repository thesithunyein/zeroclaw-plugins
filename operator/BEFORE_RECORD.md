# Before record — beat ~300 submissions

## 0) Your merchant pubkey (do this first)

Demo recipient must be **your** Phantom address before you pay on video.

WSL:
```bash
nano ~/.zeroclaw/config.toml
# under caixa-charge and caixa-watch:
# recipient = "<YOUR_PUBKEY>"
pkill -f 'zeroclaw daemon'
# restart daemon (see operator/README.md)
```

Or send the pubkey in chat and we’ll wire it.

## 1) Warm-up (no camera)

```
Cobra mesa 9: R$ 25
```

Must see `api.qrserver.com` QR link + `solana:`. Tap QR → image, not blank.

## 2) Record ([RECORDING.md](RECORDING.md))

Charge → QR open → Phantom pay → “já pagou?” → injection refuse.
